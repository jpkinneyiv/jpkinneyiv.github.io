Here you can find my implementation of the dice game Farkle. Farkle is a probabalistic game of rolling dice, superficially similar to Yahtzee, and it's a lot of fun for the whole family. Here's how you play:

"Farkle is a game of chance and strategy where two or more players roll dice which earn points. The goal is to be the player with 10,000 or more points on the final turn.

1. Each player starts their turn by rolling six dice.
2. After rolling, the player sets aside specific dice combinations which have a score value.
3. The player can either bank the points earned that turn to their total points and pass the dice to the next player or risk the points earned that turn and roll the ramaining dice again, hoping to earn more points.
4. If the remaining dice rolled do not have a scoring combination, then the player has “FARKLED” and points earned that turn are gone foreever.
5. If the player has successfully with some luck and strategy used all six dice to score, then the player gets to roll all six dice again for a chance to earn more points. This “hot dice” move can be repeated over and over.
6. When the player has either banked their points or Farkled, the dice are passed to the next  player.
7. The next player rolls all six dice. Play continues until it is your turn again.
8. To win at Farkle you must be the player with the highest score above 10,000 points on the final round of play." (farkle.games/official-rules/)

I hope you enjoy playing the game!
